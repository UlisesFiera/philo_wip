Version

	- wip v0.1: works, but there are leaks and missing features like the monitor.

Tasks

	- Update the Makefile based on the last projects; they are
	  at the school.

Progress

	1. Timestamps created.
	2. Coding init function, afraid of leaks cause of previous malloc's.
	3. Finishing off free_all for dinner and init; also gotta create a 
	   monitor for dead philos.
	4. I have to check the ret values in dinner and manage the end of the
	   simulation.
	5. All good but have to check if the monitor is working and if all 
	   filos are actually full on end.
	6. With a delay of 100000 works for the 4 410 input, but not the rest.
