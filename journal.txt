Version

	- wip v0.1: works, but there are leaks and missing features like the monitor.

Tasks

	- Update the Makefile based on the last projects; they are
	  at the school.

Progress

	1. Timestamps created.
	2. Coding init function, afraid of leaks cause of previous malloc's.
	3. Finishing off free_all for dinner and init; also gotta create a 
	   monitor for dead philos.
